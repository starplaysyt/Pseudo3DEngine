# Pseudo3DEngine
Default Pseudo 3D Engine with some additions. 

That type of engine had used in old games, like Doom and Wolfenstein. 
The main essence of this engine is throwing rays from camera to game objects.
This program has a compiled map in it, so if you want to change map, you need to download code and change lines in method InitMap().

Compiler: .Net Core. 
Language: C#.
Control Keys: WASD.

If you have strange artifacts on your screen try to expand window and restore it back.

Doesn't work from cmd. You need to compile it first and open from .exe file.

**I used presets from YouTube to make this))
